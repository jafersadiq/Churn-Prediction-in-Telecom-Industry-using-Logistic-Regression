## Business Problem Overview
In the telecom industry, customer churn poses a significant challenge. With customers having the option to switch between service providers, retaining high-profit customers becomes crucial. The project focuses on predicting customers at a high risk of churn using customer-level data from a leading telecom firm.

### Customer Churn Definition
Customer churn refers to the discontinuation of business between a customer and a service provider. In the telecom industry, the annual churn rate ranges from 15-25%.

## Objectives
1. Determine the percentage of churned customers and those actively using services.
2. Analyze data to identify features influencing customer churn.
3. Develop and evaluate machine learning models for accurate churn classification.

## Data Overview
The dataset includes information on:
- Customers who left in the last month (Churn column).
- Services subscribed by each customer.
- Customer account details (tenure, contract, payment method, etc.).
- Demographic information (gender, age range, partners, and dependents).

## Project Structure
- `notebooks/`: google Collab for data exploration, preprocessing, and modeling.
- `data/`: Dataset used for analysis.
- `results/`: Model outputs, visualizations, and findings.

## Project Steps
1. **Data Exploration:** Analyze features and distribution.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, etc.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identify patterns, correlations, and outliers.
4. **Model Development:** Train logistic regression models for churn prediction.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance and choose the best-fit.

## Conclusion
The project aims to provide insights into customer churn and aid in the development of retention strategies for telecom companies.
